🏏 IPL Team Selector using Genetic Algorithm
A smart team selection engine built on IPL data to choose the best possible playing XI using player stats and performance history. The project leverages a Genetic Algorithm to generate optimized teams with constraints like 7 Indian players and 4 foreign players, based on preprocessed and cleaned datasets.

🚀 Features
✅ Predictive Modeling: Datasets are curated and trained to forecast player performances.

🧬 Genetic Algorithm: Finds the best combination of players based on performance metrics.

🏏 Optimal XI Selector: Picks the strongest playing XI with 7 Indian and 4 Overseas players.

🔁 Dynamic Updates: Continuous improvements and updates as data evolves.

🧠 How It Works
Data Preparation
Cleaned and structured IPL data is loaded into the system.

Prediction Engine
Player performance is predicted using trained models (coming soon/ongoing).

Genetic Algorithm
Generates, evaluates, and evolves team combinations to find the best match:

Fitness Function: Based on player stats, balance, and team composition.

Constraints:

Minimum 7 Indian players

Maximum 4 Foreign players

Team Selection Output
Outputs the best possible team for current or upcoming matches.
